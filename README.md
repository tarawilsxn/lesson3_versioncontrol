## Project Description:
In this assignment, I created a github account and connected it to my Cloud9 account. I then used git commands in the terminal to configure git with my workspace. From there, I edited the html file to include 5 topics that I found important from this lesson's readings. Then, I edited the css file and added pictures to support my style and compliment the content of the page.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A concept I learned in this lesson is what a version control system is and why it is important for web developers to use. They keep track of all project files to make sure that any mistakes can be fixed with little to no hassle. 
2. Another concept I learned about is how Git is different from other VCSs and why it is a lot better. Because of its snapshot technique and the fact that it is a local repository make it more efficient to use.
3. Lastly, I learned the important git commands, specifically git add, git commit, and git push. These will all be important to know in the future as we continue working with git.
