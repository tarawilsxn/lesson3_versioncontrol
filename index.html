                <span class="text-muted">Benefits of VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS stands for Version Control System. What is a version control system? It is one main repository that stores all project files. A VCS makes note of who changes a file, when it was changed, what changes were made, and then it merges all of those changes onto the same file. Version Control Systems give many benefits to programmers. People are able to work on the same file at the same time and not have their changes clash. Developers can go back to old versions of the files as well. This topic interests me because my dad is a software engineer and I know how important they can be while working in teams. This is very relevant to this course because it is a way to back up all of the work we create during the class and in future endeavors. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Repositories are central file storage locations. They are very important in web development because they keep files managed and organized so nothing is lost when working on a project. There are two different types of repositories: local and remote. Local repositories are repositories that reside on a local machine of an individual user. They can be created in two different ways. You can either create a new repository or clone and existing remote repository and upload it onto your machine. Remote repositories are repositories that reside on a remote server that is shared among team members. These are common for companies who constantly work on programming projects and have multiple people who need access. This is relevant to our course as they are things that we will most likely be using in this class or in the future. I found this interesting because I’ve never really known about them but now I am aware I’ve used them before.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a lot different from other VCS and this was made very clear in all of the articles that I read. Some things that make it unique is the way that it thinks of files. When you save a file, git takes a snapshot of it and adds it to you stored files. If that snapshot is identical to another already stored file, git doesn't make a copy, it keeps the original so there aren't duplicates. Git is local, which makes a lot of the operations and actions a lot faster and smoother. Git has 3 main states of files. Committed, which is safely stored, modified, which is where a file is changed but not yet committed, and then staged, where it is marked as modified in its current version to into your next commit snapshot. I’m interested in git because it is what my dad and his team use at work. These basics are important to this class because they are the fundamentals to this service that we are going to be using. </p>

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->

                <span class="text-muted">Git Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three main git commands. Those being git add, git commit, and git push. These move files to and from the repository. There are other basic git commands that we learned about. Those being git init, git add —all, git commit -am, git log, and git status. The remote git commands are git remote, git pull, and git push. Knowing these commands is necessary and relevant for this course because from now on we are configuring all of our workspaces to git. I find these interesting because I truly want to understand git, and although it may take time, as long as I remember these commands I will be able to work with git and continue to learn it further.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Advantages of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git has many advantages. Git is a distributed VCS which means that instead of just checking out files, the whole system is cloned so even if there is a crash, nothing is lost. Another advantage of git is that every user has a complete copy on their machine, thus making it simple to access every part of the project. Also, everything is local so you can work offline and it runs much faster. Another great thing about git is that it will prevent an unintentional overwrites of a file on the shared repository. These advantages make git the perfect VCS for us to use in this class. These advantages are important to know for this course because it helps us all understand why it is the one we are using. I find these interesting because my dad uses git at work. I now understand why he uses it and how it helps him and his team members every day. .</p>
